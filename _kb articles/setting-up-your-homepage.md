The WeFoster Theme comes with a homepage template which lets you present your community features easily. The homepage is fully widgetized so it's up to you to decide which content to showcase. When you activate the WeFoster Theme some default widgets are added to your homepage which should help you get started!

## Adding Widgets to your Homepage

1.  Go to Appearance > Widgets
2.  There are 6 Widget Areas you can populate with any Widgets of your choice.

## Building Your Homepage via the Customiser

You can use the WordPress Customiser to get a live preview of your homepage whilst you are adding widgets.

1.  Go to Appearance > **Customize**
2.  Click on > **Widgets**

## Changing the Homepage Layout

Depending on your needs you can customize the appearance of your homepage. You can choose the amount of widgets you would like to display and the size of the widget areas.

*Note: Depending on the layout you choose certain widget areas might be hidden.*

1.  Go to Appearance > **Customize**
2.  Click on > **Homepage**

Here you'll see the available layout options for your homepage. Once you are done customizing save your changes and that's all there is to it!
