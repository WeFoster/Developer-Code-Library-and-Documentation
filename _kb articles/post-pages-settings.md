This area holds all the settings that affect the look of your Posts & Pages. Below is a quick overview of all the sections available. All settings come with descriptions and hopefully should explain themselves. Please let us know if you have any improvements or need further clarification about certain settings.

## Where do I find these settings?

1. Go to Appearance > Customize > **Posts & Pages**


### Featured Images

This is where you can set the height & width of your Featured Images and can apply different image effects to them.

### Note: About image resizing.

Your featured images are resized by the WeFoster Theme automatically to fit the sizes you specify. This gives you a lot of flexibility in choosing the image size that you like. It does mean that when you _change_ the image sizes these images need to be regenerated and saved again with their new dimension. If you have a lot of Featured Images this means a lot of additional space being used.
