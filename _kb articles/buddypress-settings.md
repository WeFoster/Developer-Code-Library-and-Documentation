Creating a BuddyPress theme without awesome BuddyPress customisation settings would be silly. So we have added a lot of them!

## Changing the Appearance

1. Go to Appearance > Customize > **BuddyPress**

This area holds all the settings that affect BuddyPress. Below is a quick overview of all the sections available. All settings come with descriptions and hopefully should explain themselves. Please let us know if you have any improvements or need further clarification about certain settings.

### General

Upload default avatars and cover photos for your Groups and Members and choose how the BuddyPress User Navigation Menu behaves.

### Members Directory

Change the Title of the Members Directory, add a custom introduction text and choose how many members are displayed per page.

### Activity

Change the Title of the Activity Directory and choose how many entries are displayed per page.
