Beautiful and balanced typography is an important part of any website and especially important for your community. You want your audience to keep coming back and a pleasant reading experience is a crucial factor. The Typography settings allow you to customise the fonts that are used on your site.  

## Changing Typography

1. Go to Appearance > Customize > **Typography**

In this section you'll be presented with settings to change your font size, font family and Font Weight. Once you have found a typography setting that you like press "Save Changes".
