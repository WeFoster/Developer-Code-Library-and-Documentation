After a successful  purchase you will receive an email including your download link. With this link you can download the zip file that contains your theme files.

**Please note that on Mac OSX zip files get extracted by default** - so check your downloads folder for the zip file before continuing.

## Installation via the WordPress admin panel

After downloading the .zip file to your computer here's what you need to get your theme installed.

1. Go to Appearance > **Themes** in your WordPress Admin
2. Click on **Add New/ Upload Theme**.
3. Now you can choose to upload the .zip file and click the **Install now** button.
4. Press **Activate** to start using your Theme.

## Installation via FTP

Alternatively you can also install the theme directly to your server with a FTP client (e.g. Filezilla for Windows or Cyberduck for Mac). Just drop the un-zipped theme folder into your ``…/wp-content/themes/`` folder.

 You can then head over to the WordPress Admin and see your installed theme in the _Appearance →_ _Themes_ admin screen. From there you can activate your theme by clicking on the **Activate** link.
