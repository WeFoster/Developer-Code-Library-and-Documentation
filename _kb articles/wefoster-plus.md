The documentation below is for WeFoster Plus; our premium plugin that comes with a ton of extra awesome functionality for the WeFoster theme. If you are a WeFoster Plus customer and have the WeFoster Plus plugin installed, this documentation is for you.

## Stylekits

### What are Stylekits?

Stylekits are carefully crafted designs for your WeFoster theme that you can use as a starting point for your site. We are constantly adding new Stylekits based on the requests from our community members.

When you apply a stylekit to your theme you can then easily customise every aspect of it according to the needs of your community. Check out the video below for a quick introduction.

Developer? Check out our developer documentation for Stylekits.

### Applying a Stylekit

By default the WeFoster Plus plugin comes with a range of different Stylekits you can choose from. Selecting a style kit is very easy:

1.  Go to Appearance > Customize inside your WordPress Admin
2.  Click on Stylekits
3.  Select a Stylekit you like
4.  Press “Save” in the top right and load a page inside the customiser window on your right. (for example by clicking on a menu link).

TODO: Insert GIF for selecting Stylekit.

IMPORTANT: If you have already made changes to your site design (for example by uploading a custom logo or building a custom layout) Stylekits will NOT overwrite these settings. Please see the next section to learn more

### Applying Stylekits on your existing design.

If you have already made changes to your site (for example by uploading a custom logo or building a custom layout) and you apply a different Stylekit to your design, your custom settings will NOT be overwritten. This is to prevent you from losing precious work on your design customisations and to let you experiment with different stylekits whilst keeping your customisations.

If you want to LOSE your changes and start with a fresh Stylekit with it’s default design settings do the following:

1.  Go to Appearance > Customise > Stylekits > Import/Export and Export your settings (better safe than sorry)

2.  Click on the “Reset” button inside the Customiser

3.  Choose a new Stylekit and Save your settings.

### Resetting Your Settings

If you want to go back to the default setting of your theme or stylekit simply press the “Reset” button in the top right of the Customiser.

Note: You can always export your current settings so you can easily revert to a previous design. Even your images like logos and backgrounds will be saved.

### Exporting and Importing Settings

Once you have made changes to your site and are satisfied with the design of your site, you can easily export your settings and save it on your computer for later re-use or as a back-up of your design.

1.  Go to Appearance > Customise > Stylekits > Import/Export and **Export** your settings (better safe than sorry)

### Sharing Stylekit Settings with the WeFoster Community

## BuddyPress Layouts

BuddyPress Layouts allow you to change the appearance of your BuddyPress pages easily and see the changes live.

## Custom Content

Custom Content is part of the WeFoster Plus module and gives you as a site owner the possibility to quickly insert custom content on any page of your website without having to dive into the developer documentation.

## Layouts

Layouts allow you to quickly build custom pages for your community and give you fine grained control over the appearance of your pages.
