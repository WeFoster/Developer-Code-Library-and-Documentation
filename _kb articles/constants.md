**CONSTANTS** are for setting default values that are defined inside your Child THEME functions.php file. Constants are being used for controlling the layout, default images and a bunch of bells and whistles that are added to the theme.

## Changing Default Values

Every constant has a default value that is being used by the WeFoster parent theme to build the default theme. By changing the values of these constants in your child theme or style kit you can quickly build custom themes. Itâ€™s pretty sweet and super accessible.

## Where can I find the available constants

You can find all the available constants in the file

    wefoster/lib/constants.php
    

[Or for the lazy here's a link to our GitHub Repo][1]
