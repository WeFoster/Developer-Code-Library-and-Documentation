Welcome to the WeFoster theme documentation. This is where you’ll find everything you need to quickly launch your community using the WeFoster theme. Let’s get started!

Note: Are you a developer? Take a look at our Developer documentation.

## After Activation

When you first activate the WeFoster theme it automatically configures itself using our recommended settings. This means that a navigation menu is created, widgets are added to your sidebars and your homepage is set up automagically. Sweet huh?

## Sidebars & Widgets

The WeFoster theme comes with several different sidebar areas you can populate with the Widgets of your choice. This allows you to show different widgets on different areas of your site. If you have never used sidebars and widgets before, here are some good resources to quickly get you up to speed with how they work.

**What are Widgets?**

**Using Widgets (Video)**

As you can see Widgets are very powerful and allow you to truly customize the experience for your users by showing different (dynamic) content across your site.

## Menus

Never set up Menus before in WordPress? No worries, here are some videos on how Menus work

Your WeFoster Theme can have a maximum of three menus based on the layout you've chose in your appearance settings (more about those later)

![WordPress Menus][1]

### Primary Navigation Menu

The Primary Navigation menu is the menu that is always used by the WeFoster Theme and it's also the one that is automatically configured as soon as you activate your theme. This menu is used by your users to navigate your site and you can add navigation links two levels deep.

### Secondary Navigation Menu

Depending on the layout you have created using the Appearance settings (more about those later!) you might want be able to use a secondary navigation. This is useful if your community has lots of content or you need additional navigation real estate.

### BuddyPress Member Navigation Menu

This menu is only shown when BuddyPress is active and shows a multi-level navigation that allows your users to quickly navigate across your site. It also shows their Notifications, Profile Photo and optionally their full name.

## Homepage Setup

The WeFoster Theme comes with a homepage template which lets you present your community features easily. The homepage is fully widgetized so it's up to you to decide which content to showcase. When you activate the WeFoster Theme some default widgets are added to your homepage which should help you get started!

### Adding Widgets to your Homepage

1.  Go to Appearance > Widgets
2.  There are 6 Widget Areas you can populate with any Widgets of your choice.

![Homepage Widgets][3]

### Building Your Homepage via the Customiser

You can use the WordPress Customiser to get a live preview of your homepage whilst you are adding widgets.

1.  Go to Appearance > **Customize**
2.  Click on > **Widgets**

![Customiser Widget][4]

### Changing the Homepage Layout

Depending on your needs you can customize the appearance of your homepage. You can choose the amount of widgets you would like to display and the size of the widget areas.

*Note: Depending on the layout you choose certain widget areas might be hidden.*

1.  Go to Appearance > **Customize**
2.  Click on > **Homepage**

Here you'll see the available layout options for your homepage. Once you are done customizing save your changes and that's all there is to it!
