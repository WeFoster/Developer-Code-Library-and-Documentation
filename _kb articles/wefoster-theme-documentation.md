Welcome to the WeFoster theme documentation. This is where you’ll find everything you need to quickly launch your community using the WeFoster theme. Let’s get started!

Note: Are you a developer? Take a look at our Developer documentation.

## Installation

Rather watch a video than read the documentation? Check the video below:

TODO: Installation Video. This needs a video!

## Setting up your community

When you first activate the WeFoster theme it automatically configures itself using our recommended settings. This means that a navigation menu is created, widgets are added to your sidebars and your homepage is set up automagically. Sweet huh? The following sections will describe how to make your community your own.

### Homepage

### Sidebars & Widgets

The WeFoster theme comes with several different sidebar areas you can populate with the Widgets of your choice. This allows you to show different widgets on different areas of your site. If you have never used sidebars and widgets before, here are some good resources to quickly get you up to speed with how they work.

### Menus

By default the WeFoster theme has two navigation menus; Secondary and Primary. Depending on the type of layout you are using they will be available for you to populate with navigation items.

If you have never used sidebars and widgets before, here are some good resources to quickly get you up to speed with how they work.

## Customisations

The following section will dive into customising your theme by changing the layout, appearance, typography and some individual areas of your community.

Keep reading or check out the overview video below.

We will not describe and cover every customisation option because every option also comes with a description and contextual help.

### Appearance

Appearance > Customise > Appearance

The Appearance settings allow you to change the layout and appearance of your site. For example placing the sidebar on the right or left side of the page, or setting a background image for your site.

The Appearance options are divided based on the area of your layout it applies to.

*   Body
*   Header
*   Content
*   Sidebar
*   Footer

There a dozens of layout variations possible and layouts can be shared and downloaded for free on WeFoster.co.

### Typography

Appearance > Customise > Typography

The typography section gives you the ability to mix and match different fonts and apply them to different elements of your site. You can also control the size and weight of the fonts (bold, regular) to create a unique font stack for your site.

The Typography settings are divided into the following sections:

*   Global (affect all elements on your page)
*   Headings (Headings like H1,H2 and Post/Page Titles)
*   Navigation (Menus and Navigation elements)

In general we would recommend you choose font faces and keep your site copy easy to read and balanced. If you are unsure about a combination you can always ask for feedback in our community forums or use one of our carefully designed Stylekits.

### Stylekits

*Stylekits are carefully crafted designs for your WeFoster theme that you can use as a starting point for your site. We are constantly adding new Stylekits based on the requests from our community members*.

When you apply a stylekit to your theme you can then easily customise every aspect of it according to the needs of your community. Check out the video below for a quick introduction.

To use Stylekits you need to have a WeFoster Plus subscription and the WeFoster Plus plugin installed.

Looking for the Stylekit Documentation? Check out the WeFoster Plus documentation for all the details.

The WeFoster Theme was developed from the ground up with BuddyPress in mind. Because every community is unique we’ve included a few customisation options to quickly create something unique.

### Resetting Your Settings

If you want to go back to the default setting of your theme or stylekit simply press the “Reset” button in the top right of the Customiser.

Note: You can always export your current settings so you can easily revert to a previous design. Even your images like logos and backgrounds will be saved.

### Exporting and Importing Settings

Once you have made changes to your site and are satisfied with the design of your site, you can easily export your settings and save it on your computer for later re-use or as a back-up of your design.

1.  Go to Appearance > Customise > Stylekits > Import/Export and **Export** your settings (better safe than sorry)
