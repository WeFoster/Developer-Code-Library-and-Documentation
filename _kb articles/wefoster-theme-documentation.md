Welcome to the WeFoster theme documentation. This is where you’ll find everything you need to quickly launch your community using the WeFoster theme. Let’s get started!

Note: Are you a developer? Take a look at our Developer documentation.

## After Activation

When you first activate the WeFoster theme it automatically configures itself using our recommended settings. This means that a navigation menu is created, widgets are added to your sidebars and your homepage is set up automagically. Sweet huh?

## Sidebars & Widgets

The WeFoster theme comes with several different sidebar areas you can populate with the Widgets of your choice. This allows you to show different widgets on different areas of your site. If you have never used sidebars and widgets before, here are some good resources to quickly get you up to speed with how they work.

**What are Widgets?**

**Using Widgets (Video)**

As you can see Widgets are very powerful and allow you to truly customize the experience for your users by showing different (dynamic) content across your site.

## Menus

Never set up Menus before in WordPress? No worries, here are some videos on how Menus work

Your WeFoster Theme can have a maximum of three menus based on the layout you've chose in your appearance settings (more about those later)

![WordPress Menus][1]

### Primary Navigation Menu

The Primary Navigation menu is the menu that is always used by the WeFoster Theme and it's also the one that is automatically configured as soon as you activate your theme. This menu is used by your users to navigate your site and you can add navigation links two levels deep.

![Customiser Menu][2]

### Secondary Navigation Menu

Depending on the layout you have created using the Appearance settings (more about those later!) you might want be able to use a secondary navigation. This is useful if your community has lots of content or you need additional navigation real estate.

### BuddyPress Member Navigation Menu

This menu is only shown when BuddyPress is active and shows a multi-level navigation that allows your users to quickly navigate across your site. It also shows their Notifications, Profile Photo and optionally their full name.

## Homepage Setup

The WeFoster Theme comes with a homepage template which lets you present your community features easily. The homepage is fully widgetized so it's up to you to decide which content to showcase. When you activate the WeFoster Theme some default widgets are added to your homepage which should help you get started!

### Adding Widgets to your Homepage

1.  Go to Appearance > Widgets
2.  There are 6 Widget Areas you can populate with any Widgets of your choice.

![Homepage Widgets][3]

### Building Your Homepage via the Customiser

You can use the WordPress Customiser to get a live preview of your homepage whilst you are adding widgets.

1.  Go to Appearance > **Customize**
2.  Click on > **Widgets**

![Customiser Widget][4]

### Changing the Homepage Layout

Depending on your needs you can customize the appearance of your homepage. You can choose the amount of widgets you would like to display and the size of the widget areas.

*Note: Depending on the layout you choose certain widget areas might be hidden.*

1.  Go to Appearance > **Customize**
2.  Click on > **Homepage**

Here you'll see the available layout options for your homepage. Once you are done customizing save your changes and that's all there is to it!

### Extending the Homepage (Developers & Advanced Users)

The homepage template can be extended via actions, filters and constants. Additionally you can overwrite the template contents inside your child theme. Take a look at the additional reading links at the bottom of this article.

## Using the Customizer

There are over 70 settings available that allow you to build a custom design for your site and customise everything to your hearts desire. Let's walk you through the sections in the Customiser that can be found here:

1.  Appearance > **Customise**

### Stylekits

Stylekits are carefully crafted designs and pre-made site configurations that you can quickly apply to your theme. Choose a Stylekit that you like and make it your own. WeFoster Plus customers can save, export and import Stylekits that they have created or have been made by other WeFoster community members. It's an extremely powerful feature that we're very proud of.

#### Applying Stylekits

### Appearance

This area holds all the settings that change the appearance of your community. Below is a quick overview of all the sections available. All settings come with descriptions and hopefully should explain themselves. Please let us know if you have any improvements or need further clarification about certain settings.

#### Body

This is where you can upload a background image and change the layout type (boxed layout, full width layout etc).

#### Logo

Choose from a set of pre-made logos or upload your own. You have the option to choose/upload a different logo for mobile devices.

Beautiful and balanced typography is an important part of any website and especially important for your community. You want your audience to keep coming back and a pleasant reading experience is a crucial factor. The Typography settings allow you to customise the fonts that are used on your site.

#### Global

In this section you'll be presented with settings to change your font size, font family and Font Weight for your entire design. Once you have found a typography setting that you like press "Save Changes".

![Typography][5]

### BuddyPress

Creating a BuddyPress theme without awesome BuddyPress customization settings would be silly. So we have added a lot of them! Below is a quick overview of all the sections available. All settings come with descriptions and hopefully should explain themselves. Please let us know if you have any improvements or need further clarification about certain settings.

#### General

Upload default avatars and cover photos for your Groups and Members and choose how the BuddyPress User Navigation Menu behaves.

#### Members Directory

Change the Title of the Members Directory, add a custom introduction text and choose how many members are displayed per page.

#### Groups Directory

Change the Title of the Groups Directory, add a custom introduction text and choose how many groups are displayed per page.

#### Activity

Change the Title of the Activity Directory and choose how many entries are displayed per page.

### Post & Page Settings

This area holds all the settings that affect the look of your Posts & Pages. Below is a quick overview of all the sections available. All settings come with descriptions and hopefully should explain themselves. Please let us know if you have any improvements or need further clarification about certain settings.

#### Featured Images

This is where you can set the height & width of your Featured Images and can apply different image effects to them.

**About image resizing.** *Your featured images are resized by the WeFoster Theme automatically to fit the sizes you specify. This gives you a lot of flexibility in choosing the image size that you like. It does mean that when you change the image sizes these images need to be regenerated and saved again with their new dimension. If you have a lot of Featured Images this means a lot of additional space being used.*
