Because there are multiple ways to achieve the same results using either a constant, action or a filter, keep the following in mind when youâ€™re building a layout for your WeFoster Theme

TODO: GIST EXAMPLE

*   **CONSTANTS** are for setting **default values** that are set globally (across your theme). They are inflexible and are the foundation of your layout across your theme.

TODO: GIST EXAMPLE

*   **FILTERS** can **overwrite** your CONTANT values on a per page basis. For example if you need a different layout for a certain page/post-type or page template. 

TODO: GIST EXAMPLE

*   **ACTIONS** Are use to **add** additional content to your layout. So instead of overwriting a value (like a filter does) you add something extra to it. For example an additional CSS class!

TODO: GIST EXAMPLE

*   **SETTINGS/OPTIONS** serve as a an easy way to apply filters or actions across the theme based on their value set inside the customizer.
