Because there are multiple ways to achieve the same results using either a constant, action or a filter, keep the following in mind when youâ€™re building a layout for your WeFoster Theme

*   **CONSTANTS** are for setting **default values** that are set globally (across your theme). They are inflexible and are the foundation of your layout across your theme.

*   **FILTERS** are a more flexible way to **modify** or overwrite default functionality. Whilst a constant is applied everywhere, a filter can be used only on a specific page/area of your site. The code snippet below shows how you can use filters to change the site layout for a certain page/post-type or page template only.

*   **ACTIONS** Are use to **add** additional content to your layout. So instead of overwriting a value (like a filter does) you add something extra to it. For example an additional CSS class!
