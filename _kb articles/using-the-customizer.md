There are over 70 settings available that allow you to build a custom design for your site and customise everything to your hearts desire. Let's walk you through the sections in the Customiser that can be found here:

1.  Appearance > **Customise**

## Stylekits

Stylekits are carefully crafted designs and pre-made site configurations that you can quickly apply to your theme. Choose a Stylekit that you like and make it your own. WeFoster Plus customers can save, export and import Stylekits that they have created or have been made by other WeFoster community members. It's an extremely powerful feature that we're very proud of.

#### Applying Stylekits

## Appearance

This area holds all the settings that change the appearance of your community. Below is a quick overview of all the sections available. All settings come with descriptions and hopefully should explain themselves. Please let us know if you have any improvements or need further clarification about certain settings.

### Body

This is where you can upload a background image and change the layout type (boxed layout, full width layout etc).

### Logo

Choose from a set of pre-made logos or upload your own. You have the option to choose/upload a different logo for mobile devices.

Beautiful and balanced typography is an important part of any website and especially important for your community. You want your audience to keep coming back and a pleasant reading experience is a crucial factor. The Typography settings allow you to customise the fonts that are used on your site.

## BuddyPress

Creating a BuddyPress theme without awesome BuddyPress customization settings would be silly. So we have added a lot of them! Below is a quick overview of all the sections available. All settings come with descriptions and hopefully should explain themselves. Please let us know if you have any improvements or need further clarification about certain settings.

### General

## Post & Page Settings

This area holds all the settings that affect the look of your Posts & Pages. Below is a quick overview of all the sections available. All settings come with descriptions and hopefully should explain themselves. Please let us know if you have any improvements or need further clarification about certain settings.

### Featured Images

This is where you can set the height & width of your Featured Images and can apply different image effects to them.

**About image resizing.** *Your featured images are resized by the WeFoster Theme automatically to fit the sizes you specify. This gives you a lot of flexibility in choosing the image size that you like. It does mean that when you change the image sizes these images need to be regenerated and saved again with their new dimension. If you have a lot of Featured Images this means a lot of additional space being used.*
